This is a Flexbox practice following the "Interneting Is Hard"'s Flexbox tutorial(NÂº 8. of HTML & CSS Is Hard).

Things I learnt with  this practice:
    flexbox overview
    flex containers
    aligning a flex item
    distributing flex items
    grouping flex items
    cross-axis alignment
    wrapping flex items
    flex container direction
    flex container order
    flex item order
    flex item alignment
    flexible items
    auto-margins

Flexbox is a great tool for laying out a web page. It's great for responsive web design and is much easier compared to floats.

Here are some Flexbox properties and their use-cases:
    Use display: flex; to create a flex container.
    Use justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.
    Use align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.
    Use flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows.
    Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order.
    Use order to customize the order of individual elements.
    Use align-self to vertically align individual items.
    Use flex to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.
